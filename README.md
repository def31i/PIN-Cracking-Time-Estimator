My simulation of a PIN cracker (PURELY EDUCATIONAL!)
This program checks approximately how long a threat actor would take to crack a digit password and also returns the number of attempts made.
A solution to such an attack would be the use of Multi-factor authentication where a threat actor would have to bypass multiple layers of security to gain access rather than just one. It also highlights the importance of using strong multi character based passwords.
