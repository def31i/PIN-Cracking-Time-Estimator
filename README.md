# Pin cracking simulation
⚠️ Disclaimer:  
This project is for **educational and research purposes only**.  
It does not target real systems and should never be used for unauthorized access.  

This program estimates how long a threat actor might take to brute force a numeric password and tracks the number of attempts required.
Purpose:
-Demonstrates the risks of weak passwords.
-Highlights the importance of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) as a security measure.
-Emphasizes why strong, multi-character passwords are more secure than short numeric ones.

Note again:
-This is a local simulation only and does not interact with real systems.
-The project is designed to raise cybersecurity awareness and is not a hacking tool.
